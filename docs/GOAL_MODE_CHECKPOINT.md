# Goal Mode Checkpoint

Last updated: 2026-06-24 neutral loss guard paper loop

Purpose: keep this file small enough to read on every resume. Full historical
context is archived at:

- `docs/archive/GOAL_MODE_CHECKPOINT_2026-06-24_pre_token_trim.md`
- Future short goal prompt: `docs/goal-mode-minimal-prompt.md`

## Objective

Build a safe paper-operation trading research and monitoring system. Do not
build or enable live order execution.

## Hard Safety Rules

- No real orders, no live-trading default, no Toss API calls in tests.
- Keep `PRODUCTION_TRADING_ENABLED` disabled by default.
- Never print, summarize, commit, or copy `.env` secrets.
- Monthly workflows are report/diagnostic/plan-only.
- Treat production/readiness BLOCK as a hard stop.
- Preserve deterministic `unittest` coverage and CLI compatibility.

## Resume Protocol

After compaction or a fresh resume:

1. Read the goal objective file.
2. Read this checkpoint.
3. Run `git status --short`.
4. Check latest `production-check` and `health-check` reports.
5. Reconfirm rejected candidates and current blockers before editing.

Keep future checkpoint updates short. Archive old loop detail instead of
appending long command logs or full report lists here.

## Current State

- Previous pushed checkpoint/context commit before this loop:
  `9a96e5c Compact goal mode prompt context`.
- Latest completed local goal commit before this loop:
  `f0fda47 Summarize proxy decision contexts`.
- Expected dirty worktree: many pre-existing unrelated modified/untracked files
  remain outside recent goal loops. Do not revert them.
- Latest full tests: `python -m unittest discover -s tests` PASS, `474` tests.
- Latest compile: `python -m compileall -q backtester` PASS.
- Latest production-check: BLOCK, `BLOCK=8`, `PASS=31`, `WARN=8`.
- Latest health-check: WARN only because scalper data is stale
  (`age_hours=339.45` observed).
- Production remains not live-ready.

## Latest Loop

Added a default-off, paper-only neutral-breadth proxy loss guard and validated
it as a new research candidate layered on `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5`.

Changed behavior:

- New `market_beta_proxy_neutral_loss_guard_*` config/CLI fields default off:
  max exposure `1.0`, lookbacks `0`, thresholds `0.0`.
- When explicitly enabled, the guard can cap neutral-breadth proxy exposure
  only if medium and optional short proxy-basket returns are below configured
  thresholds.
- The guard is disabled by default. No live-order, production default, Toss API,
  or baseline validation behavior changed.

TDD:

- RED: new neutral-loss guard import/decision tests and CLI help assertions
  failed before implementation.
- GREEN: targeted guard tests PASS, monthly module PASS (`186` tests), CLI
  module PASS (`49` tests).
- Final verification: full `unittest` PASS (`474` tests), compile PASS,
  production-check remains BLOCK, health-check remains WARN from stale scalper
  data only.

Candidate evidence:

- Candidate label: `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5_neutral_loss_guard55`.
- Explicit paper args: neutral loss guard max exposure `0.55`, medium lookback
  `40`, medium max return `35`, short lookback `20`, short max return `15`,
  layered on the existing `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5` reversal guard.
- Focused `regime_sideways`: excess improved from prior candidate `-5.2338%`
  to `-4.0548%`; max DD moved from `-21.7254%` to `-21.7902%`.
- The guard capped `2024-10`, `2024-11`, and `2024-12` to `0.55` exposure.
  It preserved `2025-02` high-exposure strong-breadth recovery at `0.99` and
  `2025-04` drawdown-scaled strong-breadth recovery at `0.7425`.
- Full validation versus production baseline: `IMPROVED`, `PAPER_REVIEW`,
  required failures `5 -> 1`, no new failures.
- Full validation versus previous best candidate: required failures `2 -> 1`.
- Remaining failed required scenario: `regime_sideways`
  (`negative_excess_return`, excess `-4.0548%`, max DD `-21.7902%`).

Prior `regime_sideways` path-summary evidence versus
`proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5`:

- `neutral_breadth_cap75`: `107/126` equity-regression days, `47`
  drawdown-regression days, `35` symbol-rotation days; worst equity delta
  `-657162.0359` on `2024-10-29`.
- `buyable_proxy`: `108/126` equity-regression days, `101`
  drawdown-regression days, `39` symbol-rotation days; worst equity delta
  `-172507.1649` on `2024-12-09`.
- `cash_reserve_proxy`: `104/126` equity-regression days, `68`
  drawdown-regression days, `39` symbol-rotation days; worst equity delta
  `-271623.8209` on `2025-01-08`.
- Decision: do not promote these variants. The blocker is not explained by
  below-one-share execution gaps alone; broad proxy reweighting/buyability/cash
  reserve changes degrade path behavior across many days.

Prior `walk_forward_003` no-trade context to preserve:

Focused `walk_forward_003` evidence for `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5`:

- Baseline persistence `1`: avg stability excess `-31.7252%`, worst
  `-53.3186%`, negative windows `6/6`; no-trade `3`, positive-benchmark
  no-trade `3`, total no-trade benchmark return `43.4006%`.
- Persistence `2`: avg `-25.1776%`, worst `-38.1485%`, negative windows
  still `6/6`; no-trade `6`, positive-benchmark no-trade `6`, total
  no-trade benchmark return `151.0656%`.
- Persistence `3`: avg `-25.1776%`, worst `-38.1485%`, negative windows
  still `6/6`; no-trade `6`, positive-benchmark no-trade `6`, total
  no-trade benchmark return `151.0656%`.
- Decision: do not promote stricter target persistence as-is. It suppresses
  path drift by suppressing direct-alpha trades, increasing opportunity cost.

Prior `walk_forward_003` diagnostic context to preserve:

- Train decision rows: `13`; `no_train_symbols=7`,
  `no_eligible_direct_candidate=6`.
- The train rejection is evidence-backed; do not loosen gates.

Prior buyability context to preserve:

- `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5 + market_beta_proxy_buyable_only`: removed
  below-one-share gaps but worsened most `regime_sideways` path days
  (`108/126` equity regression days).
- `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5_execution_gap.csv`: rows `55`;
  `target_underfilled_after_rebalance=51`, `target_value_below_one_share=4`.
- `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5_neutral_breadth_cap75_execution_gap.csv`:
  rows `57`; `target_underfilled_after_rebalance=51`,
  `target_value_below_one_share=6`.
- `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5 + market_beta_proxy_unbuyable_cash_reserve`:
  total `-9.21%`, excess `-7.15%`, max DD `-21.78%`; rejected as-is.

## Current Best Candidate

`proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5_neutral_loss_guard55` is the best fully
validated paper-review candidate.

Result:

- Baseline required failures: `5`.
- Candidate required failures: `1`.
- Failed delta: `-4`.
- Decision: `PAPER_REVIEW`, not adopt/promote.

Why useful:

- Fixed `stress_exclude_500pct_winners`, `walk_forward_001`,
  `walk_forward_003`, and `walk_forward_005` without new failures.
- Preserved useful strong-breadth recovery participation while reducing the
  neutral-breadth high-exposure loss cluster in `regime_sideways`.

Why still blocked:

- `regime_sideways` still has negative excess.
- Production/readiness remains BLOCK and target scale stays `0`.

## Do Not Reuse As-Is

- `proxy_chase_guard_55_med35_short30`: introduced `walk_forward_002` failure.
- `neutral_breadth_proxy_cap_50`: full-period/stress-slippage regressions.
- `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5_neutral_breadth_cap75`: diagnostic-only;
  reduced failures to `1` but worsened `regime_sideways`; path summary shows
  `107/126` equity-regression days versus `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5`.
- `position_stop_12`, `weak_cash_10_position_stop_12`,
  `weak_defense_cash_10`: unresolved blockers/regressions.
- `neutral_breadth_proxy_cap_75`, `target_persistence_2`: held/unchanged.
- `proxy_reversal_guard_55_extreme60`, `proxy_guard_short5_extreme50_mdd10`:
  paper-review only; improved but still left required failures.
- `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5 + market_beta_proxy_buyable_only`: removes
  below-one-share gaps but worsens most `regime_sideways` path days
  (`108/126` equity-regression days).
- `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5 + market_beta_proxy_unbuyable_cash_reserve`:
  makes cash reserve explicit but worsens `regime_sideways` excess and path
  (`104/126` equity-regression days).

## Remaining Blockers

Production baseline required failures:

- `stress_exclude_500pct_winners`: max DD about `-28.0835%`.
- `regime_sideways`: excess about `-7.1648%`.
- `walk_forward_001`: excess about `-0.7420%`.
- `walk_forward_003`: train rejected; train excess about `-1.3447%`.
- `walk_forward_005`: excess about `-5.5812%`.

Best candidate remaining failure:

- `regime_sideways`: excess `-4.0548%`, max DD `-21.7902%`.

Diagnostic combo remaining failure:

- `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5_neutral_breadth_cap75` leaves only
  `regime_sideways`, but it worsens that blocker and needs a clean full rerun
  before it can be compared operationally.

## Next Work

Pick one narrow loop:

- `regime_sideways`: the neutral loss guard reduced but did not solve the
  remaining excess gap. Next paper-only work should explain the residual
  `2025-03`/path drawdown pressure without broadening the cap into
  strong-breadth recovery months.
- `walk_forward_003`: now passes under the best candidate. Preserve train-gate
  discipline; do not loosen rejected train windows.

For code changes, use test-first work and finish with focused tests, full
`unittest`, `compileall`, production-check, health-check, checkpoint update,
commit, and push only with explicit approval.
