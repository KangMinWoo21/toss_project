# Goal Mode Checkpoint

Last updated: 2026-06-24 January contribution overlap comparison

Purpose: keep this file small enough to read on every resume. Full historical
context is archived at:

- `docs/archive/GOAL_MODE_CHECKPOINT_2026-06-24_pre_token_trim.md`
- Future short goal prompt: `docs/goal-mode-minimal-prompt.md`

## Objective

Build a safe paper-operation trading research and monitoring system. Do not
build or enable live order execution.

## Hard Safety Rules

- No real orders, no live-trading default, no Toss API calls in tests.
- Keep `PRODUCTION_TRADING_ENABLED` disabled by default.
- Never print, summarize, commit, or copy `.env` secrets.
- Monthly workflows are report/diagnostic/plan-only.
- Treat production/readiness BLOCK as a hard stop.
- Preserve deterministic `unittest` coverage and CLI compatibility.

## Resume Protocol

After compaction or a fresh resume:

1. Read the goal objective file.
2. Read this checkpoint.
3. Run `git status --short`.
4. Check latest `production-check` and `health-check` reports.
5. Reconfirm rejected candidates and current blockers before editing.

Keep future checkpoint updates short. Archive old loop detail instead of
appending long command logs or full report lists here.

## Current State

- Previous pushed checkpoint/context commit before this loop:
  `9a96e5c Compact goal mode prompt context`.
- Latest completed local goal commit:
  `Add January contribution overlap comparison` (current HEAD after this loop).
- Expected dirty worktree: many pre-existing unrelated modified/untracked files
  remain outside recent goal loops. Do not revert them.
- Latest full tests: `python -m unittest discover -s tests` PASS, `505` tests.
- Latest compile: `python -m compileall -q backtester` PASS.
- Latest production-check: BLOCK, `BLOCK=8`, `PASS=31`, `WARN=8`.
- Latest health-check: WARN only because scalper data is stale
  (`age_hours=345.52` observed).
- Production remains not live-ready.

## Latest Loop

Added a report-only January target-contribution overlap comparison to separate
shared selected-symbol contribution from six-symbol rotation between the failed
`regime_sideways` row and passing `walk_forward_001`.

Changed behavior:

- New `monthly-compare-entry-contribution-overlap` reads failed/reference
  benchmark-contribution CSVs for one month and writes `selected_total`,
  `shared_symbols`, `rotation_symbols`, `failed_only_symbols`, and
  `reference_only_symbols` rows with target weight, selected contribution,
  contribution delta/share, symbol lists, and diagnostics.
- No strategy default, validation gate, order, live behavior, Toss API, or
  baseline behavior changed.
- Generated:
  `data/reports/regime_sideways_vs_walk_forward_001_entry_contribution_overlap_2025_01.csv`.

Verification:

- RED: focused overlap tests failed on missing analyzer/save/CLI.
- GREEN: focused analyzer/save/CLI tests PASS (`3` tests).
- Final verification: full `unittest` PASS (`505` tests), compile PASS,
  production-check remains BLOCK, health-check remains WARN from stale scalper
  data only.

Residual evidence:

- Prior entry-month comparison showed `start_date_delta_days=12`,
  reference monthly excess higher by `+10.2896`, target exposure higher by
  `+0.7425`, selected-proxy delta higher by `+7.4382`, and shared symbols
  `6/12`.
- Prior path split shows the failed pre-split `2025-01-02..2025-01-13` return was
  `+1.6148`, average exposure `0.303`, and still `-6.1225` versus the
  reference post-split return.
- On shared dates `2025-01-14..2025-01-31`, failed post-split return was only
  `+0.4198` with average exposure `0.3104`, while reference post-split return
  was `+7.7374` with average exposure `0.8791`.
- Failed post-split delta versus reference post-split: return `-7.3175`,
  exposure `-0.5687`, shared symbols `6/12`; diagnostic:
  `reference_post_outperformed;reference_exposure_higher;symbol_rotation`.
- New target-contribution overlap: selected-total contribution gap `+7.4578`;
  shared symbols contribute `-0.0520` of the gap, while rotation symbols
  contribute `+7.5098` (`100.6973%` of total gap).
- Shared symbols:
  `000270;000660;005380;042660;068270;373220`.
- Rotation symbols: failed-only
  `005490;010130;051910;055550;086790;105560`; reference-only
  `000100;007660;011790;196170;277810;328130`.
- Interpretation: missed early-January timing and shared-name exposure scale
  are not the main target-contribution cause; the January target contribution
  gap is dominated by the six-symbol rotation.

Prior `regime_sideways` path-summary evidence versus
`proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5`:

- `neutral_breadth_cap75`: `107/126` equity-regression days, `47`
  drawdown-regression days, `35` symbol-rotation days; worst equity delta
  `-657162.0359` on `2024-10-29`.
- `buyable_proxy`: `108/126` equity-regression days, `101`
  drawdown-regression days, `39` symbol-rotation days; worst equity delta
  `-172507.1649` on `2024-12-09`.
- `cash_reserve_proxy`: `104/126` equity-regression days, `68`
  drawdown-regression days, `39` symbol-rotation days; worst equity delta
  `-271623.8209` on `2025-01-08`.
- Decision: do not promote these variants. The blocker is not explained by
  below-one-share execution gaps alone; broad proxy reweighting/buyability/cash
  reserve changes degrade path behavior across many days.

Prior `walk_forward_003` no-trade context to preserve:

Focused `walk_forward_003` evidence for `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5`:

- Baseline persistence `1`: avg stability excess `-31.7252%`, worst
  `-53.3186%`, negative windows `6/6`; no-trade `3`, positive-benchmark
  no-trade `3`, total no-trade benchmark return `43.4006%`.
- Persistence `2`: avg `-25.1776%`, worst `-38.1485%`, negative windows
  still `6/6`; no-trade `6`, positive-benchmark no-trade `6`, total
  no-trade benchmark return `151.0656%`.
- Persistence `3`: avg `-25.1776%`, worst `-38.1485%`, negative windows
  still `6/6`; no-trade `6`, positive-benchmark no-trade `6`, total
  no-trade benchmark return `151.0656%`.
- Decision: do not promote stricter target persistence as-is. It suppresses
  path drift by suppressing direct-alpha trades, increasing opportunity cost.

Prior `walk_forward_003` diagnostic context to preserve:

- Train decision rows: `13`; `no_train_symbols=7`,
  `no_eligible_direct_candidate=6`.
- The train rejection is evidence-backed; do not loosen gates.

Prior buyability context to preserve:

- `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5 + market_beta_proxy_buyable_only`: removed
  below-one-share gaps but worsened most `regime_sideways` path days
  (`108/126` equity regression days).
- `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5_execution_gap.csv`: rows `55`;
  `target_underfilled_after_rebalance=51`, `target_value_below_one_share=4`.
- `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5_neutral_breadth_cap75_execution_gap.csv`:
  rows `57`; `target_underfilled_after_rebalance=51`,
  `target_value_below_one_share=6`.
- `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5 + market_beta_proxy_unbuyable_cash_reserve`:
  total `-9.21%`, excess `-7.15%`, max DD `-21.78%`; rejected as-is.

## Current Best Candidate

`proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5_neutral_loss_guard55` is the best fully
validated paper-review candidate.

Result:

- Current canonical baseline required failures: `4`.
- Candidate required failures: `1`.
- Failed delta: `-3`.
- Decision: `PAPER_REVIEW`, not adopt/promote.

Why useful:

- Fixed current `walk_forward_001`, `walk_forward_003`, and
  `walk_forward_005` blockers without new failures.
- Preserved useful strong-breadth recovery participation while reducing the
  neutral-breadth high-exposure loss cluster in `regime_sideways`.

Why still blocked:

- `regime_sideways` still has negative excess.
- Production/readiness remains BLOCK and target scale stays `0`.

## Do Not Reuse As-Is

- `proxy_chase_guard_55_med35_short30`: introduced `walk_forward_002` failure.
- `neutral_breadth_proxy_cap_50`: full-period/stress-slippage regressions.
- `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5_neutral_breadth_cap75`: diagnostic-only;
  reduced failures to `1` but worsened `regime_sideways`; path summary shows
  `107/126` equity-regression days versus `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5`.
- `guarded_loss_position_stop_12`, `position_stop_12`,
  `weak_cash_10_position_stop_12`,
  `weak_defense_cash_10`: unresolved blockers/regressions.
- `neutral_breadth_proxy_cap_75`, `target_persistence_2`: held/unchanged.
- `proxy_reversal_guard_55_extreme60`, `proxy_guard_short5_extreme50_mdd10`:
  paper-review only; improved but still left required failures.
- `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5 + market_beta_proxy_buyable_only`: removes
  below-one-share gaps but worsens most `regime_sideways` path days
  (`108/126` equity-regression days).
- `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5 + market_beta_proxy_unbuyable_cash_reserve`:
  makes cash reserve explicit but worsens `regime_sideways` excess and path
  (`104/126` equity-regression days).

## Remaining Blockers

Production baseline required failures:

- `regime_sideways`: excess about `-7.1648%`, max DD about `-23.9059%`.
- `walk_forward_001`: excess about `-0.7420%`, max DD about `-25.1309%`.
- `walk_forward_003`: train rejected; train excess about `-1.3447%`.
- `walk_forward_005`: excess about `-5.2167%`, max DD about `-20.2645%`.

Best candidate remaining failure:

- `regime_sideways`: excess `-4.0548%`, max DD `-21.7902%`.

Diagnostic combo remaining failure:

- `proxy_guard_exit_short_minus5_neutral_breadth_cap75` leaves only
  `regime_sideways`, but it worsens that blocker and needs a clean full rerun
  before it can be compared operationally.

## Next Work

Pick one narrow loop:

- `regime_sideways`: the neutral loss guard reduced but did not solve the
  remaining excess gap. New benchmark-excess evidence points to missed
  `2025-04` recovery participation after the `2025-03` drawdown. Contribution
  and selection-rank evidence points to recovery-breadth/selection rather than
  only March loss control. Scenario comparison now shows low-liquidity
  missed-winner drag is shared with passing scenarios, and selected-proxy drag
  is not unique to the failed scenario. Window comparison now shows the blocker
  is in `2025-01-02..2025-04-17`, while the `2024-10..2024-12` pre-window has
  positive excess. January path subperiod comparison shows missed early-January
  timing is not the main cause, and contribution-overlap comparison shows the
  selected-target gap is dominated by six-symbol rotation rather than shared
  symbols. Next paper-only work should explain why the reference-only names
  `000100;007660;011790;196170;277810;328130` beat the failed-only names before
  testing any rule change. Avoid broad cash, broad stop, or broad proxy cap
  reuse.
- `walk_forward_003`: now passes under the best candidate. Preserve train-gate
  discipline; do not loosen rejected train windows.

For code changes, use test-first work and finish with focused tests, full
`unittest`, `compileall`, production-check, health-check, checkpoint update,
commit, and push only with explicit approval.
